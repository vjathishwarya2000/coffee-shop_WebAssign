	<p><h2>A cortado is an espresso drink made with one to two shots of espresso and a roughly equal amount of steamed milk. “Cortar” is a Spanish verb meaning "to cut," as in, the coffee is cut with hot milk. Milk can have the added benefit of cutting the acidity of the coffee as well. Compared to popular Italian coffee drinks, a cortado contains more milk than a macchiato and less than a cappuccino. The milk is also steamed and not overly frothed, which results in a different texture than most Italian coffee beverages. For this same reason, the cortado is often compared to the flat white, another drink with roughly equal parts espresso and warm milk.</h2></p>
