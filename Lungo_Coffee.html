		<p><h2>A lungo is a shot of espresso made with more water. It’s a bigger drink than a regular espresso shot because more water runs through the ground coffee, making it slightly diluted.</h2></p>

		<p><h2>“Lungo” translates to “long” in Italian, as in pulling a long shot. A short shot is called a ristretto. A regular shot (not long or short), is just called espresso.</h2></p>

		<p><h2>A lungo shot isn’t as intense as an espresso and it usually has a distinct bitterness at the end of the shot, which comes from the water being allowed to run through the espresso for a longer period of time.</h2></p>

		<p><h2>Regular espresso shots are usually an ounce, while a lungo shot can be anywhere between 1 ½ ounces to 2 ounces. Lungo is pronounced LUNG-GO.</h2></p>
