		<p><h2>Mazagran is a cold espresso drink that originally comes from Algeria, though it’s now much more popular in Portugal. It’s essentially coffee lemonade, combining citrusy acidity with the bold flavor of espresso. The lemon juice was originally added to improve the flavor of low-end coffee beans. But don’t hesitate to use your pricier beans — this tasty drink won’t ruin their flavor.</h2></p>

		<p><h2>Mazagran is credited as the “original iced coffee” and has its origin in the throes of war, as so many coffee beverages do. It was conceived in the 1800s in the coastal town of Mazagran, Algeria, where more than 100 French soldiers were held captive in an Algerian scramble for liberation against their French colonialists.</h2></p>
