	<P><h2>A caffè macchiato or espresso macchiato is a shot of espresso topped with frothed milk. The word “macchiato” means “stained” in Italian, meaning that the dark espresso is stained by the milk foam on top. Some sources say the macchiato was invented as a way to drink espresso into the afternoon.</h2></P>

	<p><h2>Here’s a coffee drink that’s one part espresso, one part foam, and equal parts delicious: the Macchiato! This espresso drink is like a lighter version of a latte, ideal for when you want a jolt of caffeine without all the extra calories. There’s a certain coffee shop that’s tarnished the macchiato’s name by causing some confusion about what it really is. Here we’ll clear up those murky waters and show you how to make a macchiato…the classic way.</h2></p>
