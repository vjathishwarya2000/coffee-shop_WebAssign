	<p><h3>Cold brew is simply coffee that has been brewed with cold rather than hot water and usually involves a long steeping process—anywhere between 12-24 hours. In terms of flavor, cold brew is generally characterized as smooth, low-acid, and heavier than its hot brewed counterparts.</h3></p>

	<P><h3>Although cold brew has been around for centuries, it’s really in the last ten years that it’s become a staple on coffee shops menus and recognizable by most coffee drinkers—a 2019 study by the National Coffee Association shows that 80% of respondents under 40 know what cold brew is and that 20% drink cold brew occasionally. “That was not the case in 2010,” Wolczynski says. “Communicating the difference between iced coffee and cold brew was difficult, let alone trying to convince people that this thing called cold brew that comes in an amber stubby bottle isn’t beer.”</h3></P>
