	<p><h2>Irish coffee is a cocktail of sweetened coffee, Irish whiskey, and whipped cream that is not only acceptable but also expected as a morning treat on holidays. Sure, St. Paddy’s Day sees a lot of Irish coffees, but we also enjoy them on Black Friday (staying home, skipping shopping) and on both Christmas Eve and Christmas morning. Last December, assistant food editor Sheela shared her uncle’s rules for making the very best Irish coffee and, being the curious cook I am, I had to give his method a try. Just a few key points made for a better Irish coffee that is perfect for celebrating the everyday</h2></p>
